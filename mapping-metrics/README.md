# Mapping Metrics

YAP gathers many mapping metrics from each step of the pipeline. 

To quickly evaluate the cell and library quality, you may start with a few key mapping metrics and recommended cutoffs:

{% page-ref page="key-mapping-metrics.md" %}

And I also provided the annotation of all mapping matrics in the `MappingSummary.csv.gz` table. 

{% page-ref page="all-mapping-metrics.md" %}
