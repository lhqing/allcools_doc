# YAP for snmC-based technologies

## What is YAP?

YAP \(**Y**et **A**nother-**P**ipeline \) is a mapping pipeline designed for several single nucleus methyl-cytosine sequencing \(snmC-seq\) based technologies.

## Technologies Supported

* [snmC-seq2 & 3](tech-background/snmc-seq.md): DNA methylome
* snmCT-seq: DNA methylome + Transcriptom
*
